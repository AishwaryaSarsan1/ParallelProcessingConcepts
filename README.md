## **Project Description**
 Real-time processing of large datasets, such as patient information, is often needed for healthcare applications. When processing huge volumes of data, traditional serial processing methods can lead to substantial performance bottlenecks, high latency, and wasteful system resource consumption. By integrating parallel processing techniques within Salesforce and utilizing the Bulk API, Asynchronous, Synchronous, Batch, Queueable, and Batch Apex, this project seeks to address these issues. The project’s maingoalistoshowhowasynchronousprocessing,whichenablesseveralactivitiestoperformconcurrently rather than sequentially, can significantly reduce processing times and increase system efficiency. The project also demonstrates the potential of parallel processing in managing massive data transactions by makinguseofSalesforce’sBulkAPIandApex,guaranteeingthatsystemresourcesstayfreeforothercrucial processeswithoutbeingimpededbyongoingchores.Usingthisstrategy,theprojectaimstoimprovesystem performance, scalability, and user efficiency in healthcare applications that handle big datasets, offering a high-performing, scalable solution for actual healthcare settings.
